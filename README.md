# Herding_financial_markets
This repository stores data and Python codes for the herding detection project. We use the Cross-Sectional Absolute Deviation (CSAD)-based model to detect herding signals. There are 3 different markets used in this experiment, including cryptocurrencies, stocks and US ETFs.
